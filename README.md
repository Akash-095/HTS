# Folder & File Setup:

- everything important is inside ./src
- /assets folder includes images, icons, logos
- /components you already know
- /constant folder includes all the static arrays we use for mapping while making components
  example: multiple links in navbar
- /hoc folder is for higher order component, used for setting common styles & animations to all  
  all the sections of page
- /utils folder is for extra ultility js functions
  inside it is /motion.js which I am using for framer motion variants
- /App.jsx is where we dump all the components
- /index.css is for extra stylings if needed, all the stylings will be done is tailwind
- /styles.js is for common tailwind classes

# Plan of execution:

- create vite app
- link tailwind css
- link three js
- add the star background
- link swiper.js for just testing atm
- create responsive navbar and other page  
  components
- use tailwind as you like
  and in the end, dump common tailwind classes
  to styles.js
- // random other steps //
- setup framer motion and other animations in the end
